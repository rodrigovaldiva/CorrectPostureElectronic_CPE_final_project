User Manual

1. Collocate the strap (tightly) around your chest and place the device in the middle of the sternum.
2. Switch on the device and follow instructions on screen to record your reference posture.
3. The display remains green for as long as the posture is right.
4. The display turns red IMMEDIATELY when in an incorrect posture, and puts out a vibration and a 
5. beep sound to alert you in case you maintain an incorrect posture for greater than five seconds.
6. Switch off the device when done using (also shuts down program automatically).

Obstacles during the project

There were two major challenges in the development of the project. One related to the software, 
and the other to the background medical research. After testing the device on ourselves, the product
 only worked on one person and the ranges had to be hardcoded, so we had to devise a solution for the 
device to adapt to physical differences. We solved this problem by getting a reference angle for every 
user’s comfortable sitting angle when the device is first started. Then we applied the ideal angle range 
to this starting angle. The device then was able to adapt to different chest structures. The other 
challenge was getting the ideal sitting angle, as many articles included different ranges. We settled 
for the angle 0° to 30° of trunk inclination after testing the device on different people. 

Looking ahead…

This project can be further improved by conducting user feedback studies to develop a more comprehensive 
and user-friendly solution. The opinions that would be collected would be related to the feedback mechanism
 and the size of the device. The device displays a red screen, vibrates, and beeps when the user is sitting
 with an incorrect posture, which could lead to interruptions, especially in the workplace. The software 
could be easily modified to suit these demands, and a good solution would be to allow the user to choose 
the device’s feedback. The device size could be considered too big for its function, so another device 
could be explored. Finally, to make the device more valuable for the user, the device could record data
 throughout the day to report patterns, and times of incorrect body posture. This data could also be 
helpful for physicians that are addressing their patient’s postural problems.
